My name is Reuben.
I am currently working at [Common Sense Machines](https://www.csm.ai), a Cambridge-based AI company focused on 3D content creation.
Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in the [Human & Machine Learning Lab](https://lake-lab.github.io) at NYU, funded by a [Google Ph.D. Fellowship in Computational Neuroscience.](https://research.googleblog.com/2018/04/announcing-2018-google-phd-fellows-for.html)
With my thesis advisor, [Brenden Lake](https://www.technologyreview.com/lists/innovators-under-35/2018/visionary/brenden-lake/), I developed a new computational framework to model the structure of human conceptual knowledge, emphasizing everyday concepts like animals, vehicles, and handwritten characters.
By reconciling key modeling ingredients from deep neural networks and structured Bayesian models, my [thesis](/assets/files/FeinmanPhDThesis.pdf) helps provide a comprehensive account for the flexibility of human concepts.
While at NYU, I completed an internship at Facebook AI Research (FAIR) where I worked directly under chief AI scientist Yann LeCun developing self-supervised learning algorithms.

Before NYU, I earned my Sc.B. in Applied Mathematics at Brown University, where I completed my thesis in computational vision with [Thomas Serre](http://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/person/thomas-serre/) and [Stuart Geman](http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/geman/index.shtml).
Following undergrad, I worked at Symantec's Center for Advanced Machine Learning in Mountain View, CA as a full-time research engineer for two years.
There, I helped found a new paradigm for the company's threat detection technologies based on artificial intelligence, filing 8 U.S. patents and improving the detection of malicious software on over 100 million customer machines worldwide.
