      <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
        <p>Have you ever played the game 20 Questions? If not, here’s how it works.
          One player conjures the name of a person, without sharing the name, and the other player asks yes-or-no questions
          about that person in an attempt to uncover who it is. If the questioner is able to uncover the chosen subject’s
          identity in less than 20 questions, then she wins; if not, her opponent wins.
          A questioner who hopes to succeed in this game follows a very distinct strategy.
          With each question, the optimal strategy is to eliminate half of the remaining field of possibilities.
          Thus, at the beginning, the questions are expected: is the person male? Is he/she under the age of 40?
          While this strategy might seem trivial on the surface, a finer look at the underlying reasoning reveals
          a phenomenon that is incredibly substantial.
          The piece of information, or “message,” stored by the answerer has a quantifiable fundamental size.
          Given the communication protocol of yes-or-no Q&A, there is one definitively optimal way to
          represent and/or communicate this message.
          The fundamental limits of representation and communication constitute a field of mathematics known as Information Theory.
          While it may sound like a bland term, Information Theory is arguably one of the most beautiful and profound
          set of ideas that our race has developed, providing a basis for fields ranging all the way from complex natural
          spectacles such as the human brain to more worldly phenomena like the stock market.<br><br>

          In order to quantify the fundamental size of a message, a metric is necessary.
          In 20 Questions that metric is the average number of yes-or-no questions required to uncover the hidden subject’s identity.
          Looking closely, one will notice that the typical number of questions required varies according to
          the player who generates the message.
          For the questioner, eliminating half of the remaining field with each iteration works great as a base
          strategy when there is no prior information about the answerer (i.e. the message source).
          In practice, however, the questioner often possesses prior knowledge about the answerer and his preferences,
          and thus she knows that all possible names will not necessarily be chosen with equal probability.
          For example, the questioner may know that this particular player knows a lot about sports, and thus there
          is a higher probability that the name will be a current or former athlete.
          In another case, the questioner may know that this player’s knowledge of history is scant, thus the name
          is more likely to be that of a person who is currently alive or who has lived within the last decade.
          The questioner can exploit her prior knowledge about the message source to build a more optimal question set (fewer Q’s).
          As it turns out, the less random that an information source is, the smaller the fundamental
          size of any message from that source.<br><br>

          If a questioner possesses prior knowledge about the other player in 20 Questions, then she has
          developed this knowledge over time, having recognized patterns in the behavior and activities of that individual.
          In the same sense, the cerebral cortex of a human infant learns to recognize and exploit rich patterns from the
          lingual and visual information emitted by the environment.
          Luckily, the words coming from the mouths of an infant’s parents are not completely random;
          rather, the rules of grammar ensure that these words have rich lingual patterns to be uncovered.
          The infant will learn to understand these language-specific patterns and exploit them for his own conceptual purposes.
          Similar to the lingual environment, the visual environment has many patterns, dictating the distributions
          of luminance and color information that is received by an infant’s eyes.
          Using these patterns, the cerebral cortex learns to detect edges and build high-level understandings
          of the visual world. These complex understandings are summarized in higher parts of the brain’s
          perceptual infrastructure as neural spike firing rates.<br><br>

          Information Theory explains the beautiful parity that exists between the seemingly distinct spectacles
          of 20 Questions and brain computation. In each case, complex data is summarized with simple, high-level representations.
          In 20 Questions, the name of a subject chosen from a vast domain of potential subjects is summarized as a
          short sequence of yes-or-no Q&As.
          In the cerebral cortex, high-dimensional data such as the wavelengths & amplitudes of light from a large
          perceptive field is summarized as a small set of neural spike firing rates.
          The systems that convert information from complex inputs to high-level summaries have learned to do so over time,
          uncovering patterns that tell about the data sources and their habits.<br><br>

          Why does a source that exhibits patterns—and thus that is less random—produce messages of smaller fundamental size?
          To understand the answer, let’s look at an example from the stock market.
          Say that, for instance, on any given day you are handed 5 price values from the NYSE.
          These could be prices of stocks such as GOOG and AAPL, prices of commodities like oil and gold,
          prices of index funds like the S&P 500 or Barclay’s Bond Index, etc.
          At first, you might think that you are handed the same amount of information from any set of 5 price values;
          regardless of what those numbers represent, you will have 5 numbers of equal precision (two decimal points),
          each of which tells something about global markets. But a closer look reveals a few subtle but key differences.
          The values in a given set may contain mutual information if the price variables in that set are known to
          be correlated with one another.
          For example, consider a set that contains the price of crude oil and the stock prices of a few major energy companies.
          The value of an energy company will be generally correlated with the price of oil; the higher the price of oil,
          the more revenue these companies can generate at equal production costs.
          Thus, when we have the price of oil in our possession, we already know a good deal about
          the prices of energy company stocks.
          By adding the price of an energy stock to our set on top of oil, we do not add as much information as
          we would if we were to add the price of GOOG, for instance.<br><br>

          Information Theory provides key insights about the laws that govern what is possible for a particular
          task given the available information resources.
          Not unlike the basic laws of physics, these laws exist in the abstract world of mathematics, and they tell us
          about the fundamental nature of the universe that we inhabit. As AI continues to grow over the next few decades,
          Information Theory will be ingrained in every element of its forward thrust.
