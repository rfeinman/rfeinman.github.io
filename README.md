**Author**: Reuben Feinman

**Bio**: My name is Reuben. I'm a PhD student in Computational Neuroscience at NYU, working with Brenden Lake. As an undergraduate researcher in the Serre Lab at Brown University, I designed the learning pipeline for a biologically inspired computer vision model with the assistance of influential mathematician Stuart Geman.  Following undergrad, I worked at Symantec's Center for Advanced Machine Learning in Mountain View, CA as a full-time research engineer for two years. There, I helped found a new paradigm for the company's anti-malware technologies based on artificial intelligence, filing 8 U.S. patents and improving the detection rates of both known and unknown malware samples on over 100 million customer machines worldwide.
