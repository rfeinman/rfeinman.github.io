# Reuben Feinman

**Bio**: My name is Reuben.
I'm a PhD student in Computational Neuroscience at NYU, working with Brenden Lake.
As an undergraduate researcher in the Serre Lab at Brown University, I designed the
learning pipeline for a biologically inspired computer vision model with the assistance of influential mathematician Stuart Geman.
Following undergrad, I worked at Symantec's Center for Advanced Machine Learning in Mountain View, CA
as a full-time research engineer for two years.
There, I helped found a new paradigm for the company's anti-malware technologies
based on artificial intelligence, filing 8 U.S. patents and improving the detection rates of
both known and unknown malware samples on over 100 million customer machines worldwide.
